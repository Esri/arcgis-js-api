{"title":"Feature Layer (ArcGISFeatureLayer)","type":"object","$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema","description":"Feature layers can be created by referencing a layer from either a map service or a feature service. Use a map service if you just want to retrieve geometries and attributes from the server and symbolize them yourself. Use a feature service if you want to take advantage of symbols from the service's source map document. Also, use a feature service if you plan on doing editing with the feature layer. Feature layers honor any feature templates configured in the source map document. Feature collection objects are used to create a feature layer based on the supplied definition.","properties":{"disablePopup":{"type":"boolean","description":"Indicates whether to allow a client to ignore popups defined by the service item."},"id":{"type":"string","description":"A unique identifying string for the layer."},"itemId":{"type":"string","description":"Optional string containing the item ID of the service if it's registered on ArcGIS Online or your organization's portal."},"layerDefinition":{"description":"Additional properties that define drawing information and other configurations for the layer.","allOf":[{"$ref":"layerDefinition_schema.json"},{"properties":{"capabilities":{},"definitionExpression":{},"drawingInfo":{"allOf":[{"$ref":"drawingInfo_schema.json"},{"properties":{"labelingInfo":{},"renderer":{},"transparency":{}},"additionalProperties":false}]},"elevationInfo":{},"featureReduction":{},"maxScale":{},"minScale":{}},"additionalProperties":false}]},"layerType":{"type":"string","description":"String indicating the layer type.","enum":["ArcGISFeatureLayer"]},"listMode":{"type":"string","description":"To show or hide layers in the layer list","enum":["hide","show"]},"opacity":{"type":"number","description":"The degree of transparency applied to the layer on the client side, where 0 is full transparency and 1 is no transparency.","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"default":1},"path":{"type":"string","description":"For offline data, a path to a geodatabase file.
