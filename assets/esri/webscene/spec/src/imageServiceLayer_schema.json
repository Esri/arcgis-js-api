{"title":"Image Service Layer (ArcGISImageServiceLayer)","type":"object","$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema","description":"An image service provides access to raster data through a web service. Multiple rasters can be served as one image service through mosaic dataset technology, dynamically processed and mosaicked on the fly. An image service supports accessing both the mosaicked image and its catalog, as well as individual rasters in the catalog. Also, image services can be cached (tiled) or uncached (dynamic). This object specifically details properties within uncached image services.","properties":{"bandIds":{"type":"array","description":"An array of bandIds that are visible for a multispectral dataset.
