In addition to this, it is also available within the operationalLayer and basemap objects.\n\nMany predefined spatial references have already been defined and are available for use. A spatial reference can be defined using a well-known ID (WKID) or well-known text (WKT). The default tolerance and resolution values for the associated coordinate system are used.\n\nA spatial reference can optionally include a definition for a vertical coordinate system (VCS), which is used to interpret the z values of a geometry.","properties":{"latestVcsWkid":{"type":"integer","description":"(Optional) The current wkid value of the vertical coordinate system."},"latestWkid":{"type":"integer","description":"(Optional) Identifies the current wkid value associated with the same spatial reference.
