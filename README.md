A minified, unbuilt version of the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) AMD modules.

| :warning:  Repository Archive Notice   |
| :-----------------------------------------|
| This repository will be archived at 4.26 (Early 2023) and then removed in a future release. All versions will continue to be available for install on NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/arcgis-js-api |

If you are starting a new project, we recommend using [@arcgis/core](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) ES modules. 

## Features

You can install these modules with [npm](https://npmjs.org/) and create your own custom builds, for example you can use [RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/) or the [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/).

## Instructions

Additional instructions and examples are available in the SDK's [Build with AMD modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/amd-build/) Guide page.

```
npm install arcgis-js-api
```

## TypeScript Typings

The TypeScript type definitions are included with the install and there are two ways to include them. The first way is to include a `///` directive in your main TypeScript file:

*main.ts*

```ts
/// <reference types="arcgis-js-api" />
```

Or, add a reference to the declaration file in the `include` of your `tsconfig.json`:

*tsconfig.json*

```json
{
  "include": [
    "node_modules/arcgis-js-api/index.d.ts",
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "src/**/*.tsx"
  ]
}
```
