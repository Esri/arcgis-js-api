        <hr/>
    <p>The Describe Dataset tool provides a more detailed look into your dataset. Before running analysis on large amounts of data, use this tool to determine what and where your input data is. By default, the  result will be a JSON string outlining key descriptors of your input layer and a table detailing the summary statistics for each field. 
    </p>
    <p>Optionally you can  create additional output feature layers to further describe your data. The options are a sample layer or an extent layer. You can choose to output one or both.
    </p>
    <p>For example, say you are given a big data file share containing 15 datasets. Each dataset has 10 million area features representing buildings and houses across different regions of your country. You are tasked with analyzing region C, but you do not know which dataset contains these features. To find out which dataset you should use, run Describe Dataset and choose to create an extent layer to investigate which dataset is in your study region.
    </p>
    <p>As another example, imagine you are tasked with completing an analysis workflow on a large volume of data. You want to try the workflow, but it could take hours or days with your full dataset. Instead of utilizing time and resources running the full analysis, create a sample layer to efficiently test your complete workflow on.

            <p>The value must be greater than zero. If you specify a number  greater than the total number of features all features will be returned.
