    <p>The Join  Features  task works with two
layers. Join  Features  joins attributes from one
feature to another based on spatial, temporal, and attribute
relationships or some combination of the  three. The tool determines all input features that meet the specified join conditions and joins the second input layer to the first. You can optionally join all features to the matching features or summarize the matching features.
    </p>
    <p>Join Features can be applied to points, lines, areas, and tables. A temporal join requires that your input data is time-enabled, and a spatial join requires that your data has a geometry.

        <div>
            <p>This determines how joins between the input layers will be handled in the output if multiple joining features are found to have the same relationship to the layer being joined. There are two join operations from which to choose:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Join one to one</b>&mdash;This option joins all the matching features to the join layer.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Join one to many</b>&mdash;This option summarizes all the matching features to each feature being joined.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>For example, suppose we wanted to find supermarkets within 5 kilometers of a farmers market.   In this case the layer being joined to has a single feature representing a farmers market, and the joining features represents the local grocery stores which has attributes such as total annual sales. Using the  <b>Join Features</b> tool, we find that five grocery stores meet that criteria. If we specified a join operation of <b>Join one to one</b>, we would end up with five features in our result, each row representing the farmers market and a supermarket. If we specified a <b>Join one to many</b> relationship, we would end up with one feature representing the farmers market and the summarized information from the supermarkets, such as the count (5), and other statistics such as the sum of annual sales.
