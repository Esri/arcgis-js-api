    <p>Creates models and generates predictions using an adaptation of Leo Breiman's random forest algorithm, which is a supervised machine learning method. Predictions can be performed for both categorical variables (classification) and continuous variables (regression). Explanatory variables are fields in the attribute table of the training features. The tool can be run to generate a model to assess performance, or generate a model and predict results to another datasets.

classes or categories (such as landcover or presence or absence).

            <p>The minimum number of observations required to keep a leaf (that is the terminal node on a tree without further splits). The default minimum for regression is 5 and the default for classification is 1. For very large data, increasing these numbers will decrease the run time of the tool.

tree. The default is 100 percent of the data. Samples for each tree
are taken randomly from two-thirds of the data specified.
            </p>
            <p>Each
decision tree in the forest is created using a random sample or
subset (approximately two-thirds) of the training data available.
Using a lower percentage of the input data for each decision tree
increases the speed of the tool for very large datasets.

decision tree.
            </p>
            <p>Each
of the decision trees in the forest is created using a random
subset of the explanatory variables specified. Increasing the
number of variables used in each decision tree will increase the
chances of overfitting your model particularly if there is one or a
couple dominant variables. A common practice is to use the square
root of the total number of explanatory variables if your  variable to predict is numeric or divide
the total number of explanatory variables by 3 if  the variable to predict is categorical.

            <p>Specifies the percentage (between 0 percent
and 50 percent) of  features in the training layer to reserve as the test dataset for validation.
The model will be trained without this random subset of data, and
the observed values for those features will be compared to the
predicted value. The default is 10 percent.

            </p>
            <p>The results returned will depend on the type of analysis. If you are training to assess model fit, results  will contain a layer of training data fit to the model and result info assessing the model fit. If you are training and predicting, results will contain a layer of the training data fit to the model, a layer of predicted results, and result info assessing the model fit.
