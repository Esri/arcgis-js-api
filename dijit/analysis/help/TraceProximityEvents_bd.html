        <hr/>
    <p> This tool traces events that are near each other in space (location) and time. The time-enabled point data must include features that represent an instant in time.
    </p>
    <p>The following terminology is used in the  Trace Proximity Events tool:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Entity&mdash;An object that has its position periodically recorded, for example, an animal, person, or vehicle. An entity can be stationary or moving.
            </li>
            <li>Entities of interest&mdash;The specific entities used to start a trace, for example, a person infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
            </li>
            <li>Proximity event&mdash;The period of time when two entities are near each other, for example, two people who come within 3 meters of each other and within a 1-minute window of each other.
            </li>
            <li>Depth&mdash;The degree of separation between an entity of interest and an entity farther down the trace (downstream). For example, a proximity event between the entity of interest and someone else is depth 1.
            </li>
            <li>Trace event&mdash;The first contact for a specified entity downstream from the entities of interest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>The
following are examples of use cases that can be performed with the  Trace Proximity Events tool:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>An organization monitors company-issued devices carried by workers. The company is interested in determining which employees were near an individual known to have COVID-19. Using the point layer representing device locations and time, the company identifies devices that have been within six meters and five minutes of the contagious person and other possibly contagious employees.
                

            </li>
            <li>An NGO is monitoring salmon populations using GPS and is interested in tracking the spread of salmon lice between escaped farmed salmon and wild populations. Some GPS-tagged farmed salmon are tracked to see if they come in close proximity with tagged wild populations, and how those wild populations may further spread the disease. The measurements also include a depth field, which the NGO uses  to only find fish at a similar depth.
