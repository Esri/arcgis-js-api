            <p>When you store a result in  ArcGIS Data Store, in most cases, results should be stored in the spatiotemporal data store. This is the default. The following are reasons why you may want to store results in a relational data store:

            <p>By setting the  <b>Parallel processing factor</b>, you can request the number of parallel workers that the raster analytics image server uses to process one raster analysis task.

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Nearest neighborhood</b>&mdash;Used primarily for discrete data, such as a land-use classification, since it does not create new pixel values. This method is also appropriate for continuous data when you want to preserve the original reflectance values in imagery for accurate multispectral analysis.  It is the most efficient in terms of processing time but may introduce small positional errors in the output image. The output image may be offset by up to half a pixel, which may cause the image to have discontinuities and a jagged appearance.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Bilinear interpolation</b>&mdash;This method is most appropriate for continuous data. It performs a bilinear interpolation and determines the new value of a cell based on a weighted distance average of the four nearest input cell centers. It creates an output image that is smoother in appearance than Nearest neighborhood but alters the reflectance values, which results in blurring or loss of image resolution.
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Cubic convolution</b>&mdash;Suitable for continuous data. This method performs a cubic convolution and determines the new value of a cell based on fitting a smooth curve through the 16 nearest input cell centers. The result is geometrically less distorted than the raster achieved with <b>Nearest neighborhood</b>, and sharper than <b>Bilinear interpolation</b>. In some cases, it can result in output pixel values outside the range of input cell values. If this is unacceptable, use the <b>Bilinear interpolation</b> method instead. <b>Cubic convolution</b> is computationally intensive and takes longer to process.
