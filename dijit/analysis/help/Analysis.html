                    <li>Given a layer of elk observations within a park over several years, mean center can be used to see where the elk congregate in summer and winter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Given a layer of fire incidents, the median center can be used to measure the central tendency of the fires without being affected by peripheral outliers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Given a layer of groundwater well samples, an ellipse can be used to determine how a contaminant is spreading.

            <p>Copies features from two or more existing layers into a new layer. Merge Layers can be used to accomplish tasks like the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a layer of public schools and a layer of private schools, and you  want a single layer showing all schools. 
                    </li>
                    <li>You have 12 layers and each contains parcel information for contiguous townships.  You want to join them together into a single layer, keeping only the attributes that have the same name and type on the 12 input layers.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>Combines two or more layers into a single layer.  You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information found in the stack. Overlay Layers can help answer questions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>What parcels are within the 100-year floodplain?
                          
                    </li>
                    <li>What roads are within what counties?
                    </li>
                    <li>What land use is on top of what soil type?
                         
                    </li>
                    <li>What wells are within abandoned military bases?
                    </li>
                </ul>
