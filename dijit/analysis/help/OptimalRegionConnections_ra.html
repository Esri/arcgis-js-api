    <p>This tool calculates the optimal connectivity network between two or more input regions.
    </p>
    <p>Example applications include the following:

        <ul>
            <li>Suitability modeling&mdash;From a suitability model, you have identified 10 of the best habitat patches for bobcats. You want the bobcats to be able to move between the patches through the most effective network of wildlife corridors to maintain genetic diversity within the metapopulation.
                

            </li>
            <li>Timber harvest&mdash;In a timber harvest, you want to create the most cost-efficient network of logging roads from which to extract the lumber.
                

            </li>
            <li>Peacekeeping&mdash;In a military peacekeeping deployment, you have identified five areas at which to position troops and personnel. You want to develop the optimally connected supply routes between the bases.
                

            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only those locations in the input layers that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed. If unchecked, all locations in both input layers will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

        <div>
            <p>The input regions to be connected by the optimal network.
            </p>
            <p>If the region input is a raster, the regions are defined by groups of contiguous (adjacent) cells of the same value. Each region must be uniquely numbered. The cells that are not part of any region must be NoData. The raster type must be integer, and the values can be either positive or negative.
            </p>
            <p>If the region input is a feature, it can be points, lines, or polygons. Polygon regions cannot be composed of multipart polygons.

            </p>
            <p>For a raster, the input type can be integer or float. Any cells that have a value (including zero) will be treated as a barrier. Any cells that are NoData will not be treated as a barrier.
            </p>
            <p>For a feature, the input can be point, line, or polygon.

        <div><h2>Choose cost raster (optional)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>A raster defining the impedance, or cost, to move planimetrically through each cell.
            </p>
            <p>The value at each cell location represents the cost-per-unit distance for moving through the cell. Each cell location value is multiplied by the cell resolution while also compensating for diagonal movement to obtain the total cost of passing through the cell.
            </p>
            <p>The values of the cost raster can be integer or floating point, but they cannot be negative or zero (you cannot have a negative or zero cost).

                <li> <b>Geodesic</b>&mdash;The distance calculation will be performed on the ellipsoid. Therefore, regardless of input or output projection, the results do not change.
