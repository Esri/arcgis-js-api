    <p>This tool finds and summarizes features that are within a specified distance of features in the first input layer.  Distance can be measured as a straight-line distance or by using a selected travel mode.  Travel mode options are driving distance, driving time, trucking distance, trucking time, walking distance, or walking time.   Statistics are then calculated for the nearby features.  For example
        <ul>
            <li>Calculate the total population within five minutes of driving time of a proposed new store location.
            </li>
            <li>Calculate the number of freeway access ramps within a one-mile driving distance of a proposed new store location to use as a measure of store accessibility.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the features in the input layer and the layer to be summarized that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed.  If unchecked, all features in both the input layer and the layer to be summarized will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

            <p> You can define what kind of distance measurement you want to use, either a straight-line distance or a selected travel mode. Travel modes are only enabled when the first input layer (the layer from which distances are measured) contains points.  The available travel modes are determined by the administrator of your organization. When using one of the travel modes, the measurements are made along roads or walkways and they honor applicable rules, such as one-way streets, illegal turns, and so on. <b>Driving Time</b>, <b>Rural Driving Time</b> and <b>Trucking Time</b> honors your choice of travel speeds, either those based on live traffic or typical traffic. Live speeds are gathered through current sensor readings and typical speeds are calculated from historical averages.
            </p>
            <p>You can enter multiple distances.  Features that are within (or equal to) the distances you enter will be summarized.

            <p>The  <b>Return bounding areas</b> check box, if checked, will return a result layer of areas defined by the specified distance measurement. The result layer will include all the requested summarized information. For example, when summarizing nearby points, if using a <b>Line distance</b> of 5 miles, your result will contain areas with a 5 mile radius around the input features and all summarized information such as count of points and any added statistics. If unchecked, the resulting layer will return the same features of the first input layer with all requested summary information.

One of the attributes of the building footprints is <i>UseType</i>, which contains values such as RETAIL, RESIDENTIAL, MANUFACTURING, PUBLIC, and so on.  To characterize the mix of building uses near each vacant parcel, you could calculate the total area of each unique type of building use within two kilometers of the vacant parcels using <i>UseType</i> as the group by attribute.
