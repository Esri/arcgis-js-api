        <hr/>
    <p>This tool identifies the areas  that the input observer locations can see, accounting for surface topography. The input point locations can represent either observers (such as people on the ground or lookouts in a fire tower), or observed objects (such as wind turbines, water towers, vehicles, or other people). The results define the areas that can be seen from the observer locations.
    </p>
    <p>Both the observers and the observed objects can have a height above ground, and these heights are used to determine visibility. For example, a viewshed computed for 300-foot wind turbines and a 6-foot tall person standing on the ground will typically be larger than a viewshed computed for 200-foot turbines and a 5-foot tall person.
    </p>
    <p>The result layer records the number of times that each cell location in the input surface raster can be seen by the input observation points. The nonvisible cells are given NoData values.
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only the raster area and the observer points that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed. If unchecked, all observer points in the input layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map extent.

        <div>
            <p>The elevation surface to use for calculating the viewshed.
            </p>
            <p>If the vertical unit of the input surface is different from the horizontal unit, such as when the elevation values are represented in feet but the coordinate system is in meters, the surface must have a defined vertical coordinate system. The reason for this is that the tool uses the vertical (Z) and horizontal (XY) units to compute a Z factor for the viewshed analysis. Without a vertical coordinate system, and thus having no Z unit information available, the tool will assume that the Z unit is same as the XY unit. The result of this is that an internal Z factor of 1.0 will be used for the analysis, which may give unexpected results.
            </p>
            <p>The elevation surface can be integer or floating point.

                <li>Speed &mdash; 
This method optimizes the processing speed, trading some accuracy in the result for higher performance. This is the default.

                </li>
                <li>Accuracy &mdash; 
This method is optimized for accuracy in the results, at the expense of a longer processing time.

    <div id="maximumDistance">
        <div><h2>Maximum viewing distance</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>Enter a cutoff distance where the computation of visible areas will stop. Beyond this distance, whether the observer points and the other objects can see each other will not be determined.
            </p>
            <p>You can either specify a numerical value representing a linear distance or select a numerical field from the input observer features. If a field is provided, the values contained in the field must be in the same unit as the x,y unit of the input elevation surface.
            </p>
            <p>Note that large values will increase computation time. Unless specified, a default maximum distance will be computed based on the resolution and extent of the input elevation surface.
            </p>
            <p>This parameter is useful for modeling certain phenomena. For example, by limiting the extent of visibility, you can model weather conditions such as a light fog. Similarly, restricting the visibility extent can give you some control over the time of day by approximating the effect of dusk.

            </p>
            <p>You can either specify a numerical value representing a linear distance or select a numerical field from the input observer features. If a field is provided, the values contained in the field must be in the same unit as the x,y unit of the input elevation surface.
            </p>
            <p>This parameter is useful for controlling the viewshed analysis area at a specific distance away from the observer. For example, if you are evaluating the visibility from a building top to a distant park, you can set a minimum viewing distance to exclude the areas close by that are of no interest and gain a better processing speed.

        <div>
            <p>Specify whether the minimum and maximum viewing distance parameters are measured in a three-dimensional way or a simpler, two-dimensional way. When the option is checked, the viewing distances are treated as a 3D distance. When unchecked, they are treated as 2D distances.
            </p> 
            <p>A 2D distance is the simple linear distance measured between an observer and the target using their projected locations at sea level. A 3D distance gives a more realistic value by taking their relative heights into consideration.

            </p>
            <p>The default is 6 feet. If you are looking from an elevated location, such as an observation tower or a tall building, use that height instead. During the viewshed calculation, this value is added to the observer elevation if it is specified; otherwise, it is added to the interpolated surface z-value.
