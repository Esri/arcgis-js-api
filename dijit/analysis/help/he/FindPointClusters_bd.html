        <hr/>
    <p>The  Find Point Clusters tool 
finds clusters of point features within surrounding noise based on their spatial distribution.
    </p>
    <p>For example, a nongovernmental organization is  studying a particular pest-borne
disease. It has a point dataset representing households in a
study area, some of which are infested, and some of which are not. By
using the  Find Point Clusters tool, an analyst can determine clusters of
infested households to help pinpoint an area to begin treatment and
extermination of pests.

        <div>
            <p>The point layer that clusters will be found in.  Layers must be in a projected spatial reference or have a processing spatial reference set to a projected coordinate system using  <b>Analysis Environments</b>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer.

        <div>
            <p>The clustering method that will be used to distinguish clusters of point features from surrounding noise. You can choose to use a defined distance or self-adjusting clustering algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>Defined distance (DBSCAN) uses a specified search range to separate dense clusters from sparser
noise. Defined distance (DBSCAN) is faster but is only
appropriate if there is a very clear search range to use that works
well to define all clusters that may be present. Defined distance (DBSCAN) finds
clusters that have similar densities.
            </p>
            <p>Self-adjusting (HDBSCAN) does not require a search range to be specified but it is a more time consuming method. Self-adjusting (HDBSCAN) finds
clusters of points similar to defined distance (DBSCAN) but uses varying search ranges
allowing for clusters with varying densities.

                    <li>Defined distance (DBSCAN)&mdash;specifies the number of features that must be found within a certain distance  of a point for that point to start to form  a cluster. The distance is defined using the  <b>Limit the search range to</b> parameter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Self-adjusting (HDBSCAN)&mdash;specifies the number of features neighboring each point (including the point itself) that will be considered when estimating density. This number is also the minimum cluster size allowed when extracting clusters.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <div id="searchDistance">
        <div><h2>Limit the search range to</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>When using defined distance (DBSCAN), this parameter is the distance within which the  <b>Minimum number of points to be considered a cluster</b> must be found. This parameter is not used when self-adjusting (HDBSCAN) is chosen as the clustering method to use.
