 You can choose to summarize within a polygon  layer that you provide or within square or hexagon bins that are generated when the tool runs.  When generating bins, for  <b>Square</b>, the number and units specified determine the height and length of the square. For <b>Hexagon</b>, the number and units specified  determine the distance between parallel sides.
            </p>
            <p>Analysis using square or hexagon bins requires a projected coordinate system. You can set the processing coordinate system in Analysis Environments. If your processing coordinate system is not set to a projected coordinate system, you will be prompted to set it when you run analysis .

            <p>If time is enabled on the input layer and it is of type instant, you can  analyze using time stepping.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:

            <p>For example, if you have data that represents a year in time and you want to analyze it using weekly steps, set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 week.  
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you have data that represents a year in time and you want to analyze it using the first week of the month, set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 week, <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> to 1 month, and <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> to <code>January 1, at 12:00 am</code>.

        <div>
            
            <p> You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. All calculations assume the data quantity type is rate and the full value of the feature is used. No values are proportioned based on the amount they are inside of the summary polygon. You can calculate the following on numeric fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;Calculates the number of nonnull values. It can be used on numeric fields or strings. The count of [null, 0, 2] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of numeric values in a field. The sum of [null, null, 3] is 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The mean of numeric values. The mean of [0, 2, null] is 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum value of a numeric field. The minimum of [0, 2, null] is 0. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum value of a numeric field. The maximum value of [0, 2, null] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The range of a numeric field. This is calculated as the minimum values subtracted from the maximum value. The range of [0, null, 1] is 1. The range of [null, 4] is 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of a numeric field in a track. The  variance of [1] is null. The variance of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of a numeric field. The standard deviation of [1] is null. The standard deviation of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.5. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate the following on string fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The number of nonnull strings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to these statistics, proportional statistics will be calculated on all numeric fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The count of each field multiplied by the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of weighted of values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The weighted mean of values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum of weighted values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum of weighted values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The difference between the maximum and minimum weighted values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of weighted values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of weighted values in each field. The weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the types of features you are summarizing, the total count of nearby points, total length of lines, or total area will be calculated.

        <div>
            <p>This is an attribute of the  <b>Summarize</b> features that you can use to calculate statistics separately for each unique attribute value. For example, suppose the first input layer contains city boundaries and the summary features are parcels.  One of the attributes of the parcels is <i>Status</i> which contains two values: VACANT and OCCUPIED. To calculate the total area of vacant and occupied parcels within the boundaries of cities,  use <i>Status</i> as the group by attribute.
 The statistics for each group, as well as the count of features within each area boundary, will be displayed in the result layer's pop-up.

            <p>GeoAnalytics results are stored to a data store and exposed as a feature layer in   Portal for ArcGIS. In most cases, results should be stored to the spatiotemporal data store, and this is the default. In some cases, saving results to the  relational data store is a good option. The following are reasons you may want to store results to the relational data store: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use results in portal-to-portal collaboration.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can enable sync capabilities with your results.

            </p>
            <p>You should not use the relational data store if you expect your GeoAnalytics results to increase and need to take advantage of the spatiotemporal big data store's capabilities to handle large amounts of data.
