        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features  and a layer of areas features.  Input area features can be from a polygon layer or they can be square or hexagonal bins calculated when the tool is run. The tool first
determines which points fall within each specified area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well. 

    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have point features of coffee shop locations and area features of counties, and you want to summarize coffee sales by county.  Assuming the  coffee shops have a    <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within each county, the minimum or maximum <i>TOTAL_SALES</i>
 within each county, or other statistics such as the count, range, standard deviation, and variance.
    </p>
    <p>This tool can also work with data that is time-enabled. If time is enabled on the input points, then the time slicing options are available. Time slicing allows you to calculate the point-in-area relationship while looking at a specific slice in time. For example, you could look at hourly intervals, which would result in outputs for each hour. 
    </p>
    <p>For an example with time, suppose you had point features of every transaction made at various coffee shop locations and no  area layer. The data has been recorded over a year and each transaction has a location and a time stamp. Assuming each transaction has a <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within the space and time of interest. If these transactions are for a single city, we could generate  areas that  are 1-kilometer grids and look at weekly time slices to summarize the transactions in both time and space.

        <div>
            <p>The point layer that will aggregate into the areas.  Point layers that are aggregated into  <b>Square </b> or <b>Hexagon</b> bins must have the processing spatial reference set to a projected coordinate system using the <b>Analysis Environments</b>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Choose Analysis Layer</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer. You may optionally apply a filter on your input layer or apply a selection on hosted layers added to your map. Filters and selections are only applied for analysis.

        <div>
            <p>The areas that the   point layer will be aggregated into. You can choose between an area layer that you provide or  bins that are generated when the tool runs.   When generating bins, for  <b>Square</b>, the number and units specified determine the height and length of the square. For <b>Hexagon</b>, the number and units specified  determine the distance between parallel sides.
            </p>
            <p>Analysis using square or hexagon bins requires a projected coordinate system. You can set the processing coordinate system in Analysis Environments. If your processing coordinate system is not set to a projected coordinate system, you will be prompted to set it when you run analysis .

        <div>
            <p>The distance used to generate bins to aggregate your input points into. For a square bin, the size represents the height of the square. For hexagon, the size represents the height of the hexagon (from parallel sides).

            <p>If time is enabled on the input layer and it is of type instant, you can  analyze using time stepping.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Time step interval</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>How often to repeat the time step</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Time to align the time steps to</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you have data that represents a year in time and you want to analyze it using weekly steps, set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 week.  
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you have data that represents a year in time and you want to analyze it using the first week of the month, set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 week, <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> to 1 month, and <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> to <code>January 1, at 12:00 am</code>.

    <div id="timeInterval">
        <div><h2>Time step interval</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>The interval of time used for generating time steps.  <b>Time step interval</b> can be used alone or with the <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> or <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> parameter.
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you want to create time steps that take place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 hour, <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> to 1 week, and <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> to <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

            </p>
            <p>For example, if you want to create time steps that take place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 hour, <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> to 1 week, and <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> to <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

        <div>
            <p>The date and time used to align time slicing. Time stepping will start at and continue backward from this time. If no reference time is selected, time stepping will align to January 1st, 1970. 
            </p>
            <p>For example, if you want to create time steps that take place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., set  <b>Time step interval</b> to 1 hour, <b>How often to repeat the time step</b> to 1 week, and <b>Time to align the time steps to</b> to <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

        <div>
            <p>You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. You can calculate the following on numeric fields: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;Calculates the number of nonnull values. It can be used on numeric fields or strings. The count of [null, 0, 2] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of numeric values in a field. The sum of [null, null, 3] is 3.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The mean of numeric values. The mean of [0, 2, null] is 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum value of a numeric field. The minimum of [0, 2, null] is 0. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum value of a numeric field. The maximum value of [0, 2, null] is 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The range of a numeric field. This is calculated as the minimum values subtracted from the maximum value. The range of [0, null, 1] is 1. The range of [null, 4] is 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance&mdash;The variance of a numeric field in a track. The  variance of [1] is null. The variance of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.25.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation&mdash;The standard deviation of a numeric field. The standard deviation of [1] is null. The standard deviation of [null, 1,0,1,1] is 0.5. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You can calculate the following on string fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The number of nonnull strings.
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.
            </p>

    <div id="spatialReference">
        <div><h2>SpatialReference (wkid)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>This is a temporary parameter for prerelease  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system be used as the spatial reference for processing. By default, the tool will use the input coordinate system but will fail if it's a geographic coordinate system. To set a projected coordinate system, enter the WKID. For example,  <b>Web Mercator</b> would be entered as <code>3857</code>.

        <div>
            <p>GeoAnalytics results are stored to a data store and exposed as a feature layer in   Portal for ArcGIS. In most cases, results should be stored to the spatiotemporal data store, and this is the default. In some cases, saving results to the  relational data store is a good option. The following are reasons you may want to store results to the relational data store: 
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use results in portal-to-portal collaboration.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can enable sync capabilities with your results.

                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>You should not use the relational data store if you expect your GeoAnalytics results to increase and need to take advantage of the spatiotemporal big data store's capabilities to handle large amounts of data.

        <div>
            <p> The name of the layer that will be created.  If you are writing to an ArcGIS Data Store, your results will be saved in  <b>My
Content</b> and added to the map. If you are writing to a big data file share, your results will be stored in the big data file share and added to its manifest. They will not be added to the map. The default name is based on the
tool name and the input layer name. If the layer already exists, the tool will fail.
