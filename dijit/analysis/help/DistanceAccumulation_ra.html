    <p>This tool calculates the accumulated distance for each cell to sources, allowing for straight-line distance, cost distance, true surface distance, and vertical and horizontal factors.
    </p>
    <p>Example applications include answering questions such as the following:

        <ul>
            <li>What is the distance to the closest town?
                

            </li>
            <li>What is the cost distance to the closest road?
                

            </li>
            <li>What is the distance around barriers to the closest water source?
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>If  <b>Use current map extent</b> is checked, only those features in the input layer that are visible within the current map extent will be analyzed. If unchecked, all features in the input layer will be analyzed, even if they are outside the current map display extent.

            </p>
            <p>In the descriptions below, the VF defines the vertical difficulty encountered in moving from one cell to the next, and the VRMA modifier identifies the slope angle between the  <b>From source</b> cell and the <b>To source</b> cell.
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Binary</b>&mdash;If the VRMA is greater than the low-cut angle and less than the high-cut angle, the VF is set to the value associated with the zero factor; otherwise, it is infinity.
                    </li>

By definition, the zero factor is not applicable to any of the trigonometric vertical functions (Cos, Sec, Cos-Sec, or Sec-Cos). The y-intercept is defined by these functions.

            <p>In the descriptions below, horizontal factor (HF) defines the horizontal difficulty encountered when moving from one cell to the next, and horizontal relative moving angle (HRMA) identifies the angle between the horizontal direction from a cell and the moving direction.
            </p>
            <p>The definitions and parameters of these HF are as follows:

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Binary</b>&mdash;If the HRMA is less than the cut angle, the HF is set to the value associated with the zero factor; otherwise, it is infinity.
                        

                    </li>

If the HRMA is greater than 0 and less than 45 degrees, the HF for the cell is set to the value associated with the zero factor. If the HRMA is greater than or equal to 45 degrees, the side value modifier value is used. The HF for any HRMA equal to or greater than 90 degrees is set to infinity.

            <p>The range of values is from 0 degrees to 360 degrees, with 0 reserved for the source cells. Due east (right) is 90, and the values increase clockwise (180 is south, 270 is west, and 360 is north).
            </p>
            <p>The output raster is of type float.

            <p>The source location raster is a multiband output. The first band contains a row index, and the second band contains a column index. These indexes identify the location of the source cell that is the least accumulated cost distance away.
