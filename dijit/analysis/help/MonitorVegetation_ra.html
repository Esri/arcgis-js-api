            <ul>
                <li>Global Environmental Monitoring Index &mdash; 
GEMI is a nonlinear vegetation index for global environmental monitoring from satellite imagery. It is similar to NDVI, but it is less sensitive to atmospheric effects. It is affected by bare soil; therefore, it is not recommended for use in areas of sparse or moderately dense vegetation.

                </li>
                <li>Green Vegetation Index - Landsat TM &mdash; 
GVI was originally designed from Landsat MSS imagery but has been modified for use with Landsat TM imagery. It is also known as the Landsat TM Tasseled Cap green vegetation index. This monitoring index can also be used with imagery whose bands share the same spectral characteristics.

                </li>
                <li>Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index &mdash; 
MSAVI2 is a vegetation index that tries to minimize bare soil influences of the SAVI method.

                </li>
                <li>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index  &mdash; 
NDVI is a standardized index allowing you to generate an image displaying greenness, or relative biomass. This index takes advantage of the contrast of the characteristics of two bands from a multispectral raster dataset: the chlorophyll pigment absorptions in the red band and the high reflectivity of plant materials in the near-infrared (NIR) band.

                </li>
                <li>Perpendicular Vegetation Index &mdash; 
PVI is similar to a difference vegetation index; however, it is sensitive to atmospheric variations. When using this method to compare different images, it should only be used on images that have been atmospherically corrected. This information can be provided by your data vendor.

                </li>
                <li>Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index &mdash; 
SAVI is a vegetation index that attempts to minimize soil brightness influences using a soil-brightness correction factor. This is often used in arid regions where vegetative cover is low.

                </li>
                <li>Sultan's Formula &mdash; 
The Sultan's Formula process takes a six-band 8-bit image and applies a specific algorithm to it to produce a three-band 8-bit image. The resulting image highlights rock formations called ophiolites on coastlines. This formula was designed based on the TM and ETM bands of a Landsat 5 or 7 scene.

                </li>
                <li>Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index &mdash; 
Transformed-SAVI is a vegetation index that attempts to minimize soil brightness influences by assuming the soil line has an arbitrary slope and intercept.

            </p>
            <p>Each satellite sensor and aerial camera captures information that is broken up into band indexes. Each band index contains the information for a specific part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This vegetation monitoring method requires you to specify the band index that captured the NIR and red wavelengths.
